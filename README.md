**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Room client was seeking enhancements for their Android game, Draw It or Lost It, and wanted to expand it to other platforms. This would help Gaming Rooms to distribute their gaming applications across various operating systems. The Client wanted a gaming experience similar to the "Win, Lose, or Draw" game show from the 80s.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
In developing the documentation, I excelled in maintaining clarity, conciseness, and relevance to the client's needs.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Working through the design document helped prioritize tasks and maintain focus on crucial aspects during code development.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
If I could revise a part of my work, I would improve the recommendations section by clarifying identified needs and their significance.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I interpreted the user's needs by breaking down the game's functionality to facilitate easier platform expansion while retaining the core gameplay. It's vital to consider the user's needs as they determine the software's success and adoption.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
In designing software, I focused on clear documentation and modularizing game functionality for easier updates and maintenance. In the future, I would continue with similar strategies while refining recommendation articulation and emphasizing user-centric design.
